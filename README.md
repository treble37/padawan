# Padawan

This is the demo repo for my talk Rebuilding a BDD Framework (ESpec) given at Empex LA 2019.
It is my attempt to see what it's like to build a simplified clone of the awesome [ESpec test framework](https://github.com/antonmi/espec)

## Running

To run:

`mix padawan`

You should see something like this in your terminal:

`Line: 6 passing...`

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `padawan` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:padawan, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/padawan>.
